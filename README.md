# how-to

Wanted to keep a record of things I don't know how to do but would love to do, it's a Nuxt static app with content taken from Contentful headless CMS

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [documentation](https://nuxtjs.org).
